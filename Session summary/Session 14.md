The party continued to explore the lost mine of Phandelver, a room of strange glowing fungi was investigated, well until it was set on fire, turns out that fungi spores are flammable!

Next was a large cavern filled with magic, glowing rocks in embedded in the ceiling,  inside the cavern were two stone built buildings, one largely intact and one that has taken a large amount of damage.   The party investigated the first building,   it seemed empty bar a chest sitting in the middle of the floor, the obvious trap was too much to resist so the party entered the room,   a wraith appeared and asked the party for gifts in exchange for their life's.   The top negotiator Bob was in charge of negotiations, the wrath demanded magic items that the party was reluctant to give up so a fight was started.   The wraith hit hard and temporarily reduced two players max hit points.  Just before the wraith was banished they summoned their minions, well a minion arrived in the form of a single ghoul which was swiftly dispatched.

The scorched chest is unlocked and contains 1,100 cp, 160
sp, 50 ep, three diamonds (100 gp each), and a wooden
pipe adorned with platinum filigree (150 gp).

A map of a dungeon was also found but sadly not of this dungeon.

The next building was in better shape, outside were bones from a recent battle piled up.  Inside the main room was a pedestal with a brazier with a green flame burning brightly.  this was guarded by a spectator, a 5 eyed floating monster.   A short fight left the monster dead and our friendly bear/wolf paralysed and then bopped on the nose by a member of the party.  The magic flame was investigated and found that it could change a normal weapon into a +1 weapon (well sometimes).   An attempt to pass the dead spectator though the flame went badly as it was bought back to life for a short time.

In the rubble a magic mace and armour were found.

**Lightbringer**. This +1 mace was made for a cleric of
Lathander, the god of dawn. The head of the mace is
shaped like a sunburst and made of solid brass. Named
Lightbringer, this weapon glows as bright as a torch when
its wielder commands. While glowing, the mace deals an
extra Id6 radiant damage to undead creatures.

**Dragonguard**. This +1 breastplate has a gold dragon
motif worked into its design. Created for a human hero of
Neverwinter named Tergon, it grants its wearer advantage
on saving throws against the breath weapons of creatures
that have the dragon type.

The party then explored a bit more and found an old store room that could be used as a secure base for a long rest.
