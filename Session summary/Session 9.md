After clearing [[Thundertree]] the party talked again with the suspiciously chilled out wizard [[Reidoth]] and found out the location of [[Cragmore castle]].    This information sort of balanced out the fact that he forgot to mention the big dragon in [[Thundertree]].

The party decided to head to [[Old owl well]] to investigate rumours of undead warning people away.  At the ruins there was a tent and met a Mage called [[Hamun Kost]] who said he was an archaeologist studying the ruins.   He seemed to be in control of the zombies there.     He stated that the orcs were causing him problems and offered the party a reward of 50Gp for each orc head from [[Wyvern Tor]].   He also asked them to ask the banshie how old the tower at [[Old owl well]] was.

The party then headed to [[Wyvern Tor]] a short lived attempt at trickery ended up with just shooting the sentry orc.

The ooze then used disguised self to mimic the dead orc.   This went well until the leader of the orcs spoke in orcish.    As expected a fight soon ensured.

The attempt to capture the leader of the orcs went badly and his head was cut off.     The remaining orcs fled with one captured.     The orc was tied up and interrogated unfortunately the only member of the party who could speak orc had the same intelligence as the orc.   The following was discovered.

1. The secret passage was secret
2. what was in the secret passage was secret.
3. The secret in the secret passage was swallows.
4. There are *many* creatures in [[Cragmore castle]]
5. Orcs cannot count past 2.
6. Orcs count 1,2,many.

At this point his head was cut off.

A scroll of speak with the dead was used to reanimate the head of the Orc leader.     This gave the party 5 questions.

1. Are there more creature in [[Cragmore castle]] than there are here?   answer yes.
2. so 6 plus 7 equals 13?  Answer correct.
3. Are there creatures larger than the orge?  Answer yes.

Question 2 almost started a fight amongst the party.

Treasure was found.  

750CP, 180SP, 62EP, 30GP and 3 vials of perfume worth 10GP each.
