The party continued to explore [[Thundertree]], the next building the party investigated housed a strange group of people that asked them to join a cult.  Half the party went off to explore further whilst the other half stayed to spy.    The cult let slip that Venomfang would soon deal with the problem party.

The party regrouped at another ruined house.  assured by aerial reconnaissance that it was safe the party entered only to be attacked by vaguely competent twig blights.

Having survived the attack by twiglets the party investigated a statue which turned out to be a statue.

The castle like barracks was the next to be investigated.    A battle with zombies was swiftly over but leaving the party with some wounds.   A short rest was taken which allowed the cultists to warn Venomfang of the party.

A sneaky attack on the main tower started badly by the sneaky player confirming that there was something at the top of the tower with very large teeth!

A hard battle was then undertaken with Venomfang who was a young green dragon.  After nearly killing the direwolf the party managed to do enough damage to make the dragon flee.

Treasure was found!

800 sp, 150 gp, four
silver goblets set with moonstones (60 gp each), a scroll of
misty step, and a scroll of lightning bolt.

and a battle axe called Hew

Hew is a +1
battleaxe that deals maximum damage when the wielder
hits a plant creature or an object made of wood. The axe's
creator was a dwarf smith who feuded with the dryads of
a forest where he cut firewood. Whoever carries the axe
feels uneasy whenever he or she travels through a forest and has disadvantage in a Forrest.

The party they returned to the cultists to "have words" but having seen the dragon flee they buggered off as well.
