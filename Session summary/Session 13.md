[[Gundren Rockseeker]] led the party to [[wave echo cave]] the lost mine he was seeking.   Unfortunately he also found the dead body of his captured brother.   [[Gundren Rockseeker]] stood vigil over the grave as the party entered the mine to locate the [[Black spider]] and reclaim the mine.

The first challenge  was to climb down a 20 foot cliff, this simple task of course went "well", the expert climber of the party went first then got confused by a wall.  The plucky fighter jumped into the gaping chasm to save the day and took damage due to the height.   The smarter members climbed down the rope that was already there, unfortunately at least one slipped and took damage.

Wandering around the party split up which of course ended badly, a Ochre Jelly separated one party member and attacked.   The rest of the party rushed to help, having discovered that slashing damage caused the Ochre Jelly to split into two,  now having the double the monsters the party killed one then almost killed the last one before forgetting about slashing damage making more monsters!

Next a barracks room was found with 3 ghouls one of which lead them on a Benny Hill style chase ending up next to and damaging the squishy magic caster who was hanging back for safety.

A cavern full of piles of bones was cautiously investigated as the party expected attacks by skeletons, unfortunately the party should have been looking upwards as a group of 12 Stirges attacked.   The party has a poor record against Stirges and this continued  with 3 attaching themselves to our magic user and other party members using great axes and eldritch blast to remove them.  Of course a Nat 1 was rolled and our poor magic user took damage.

The party retreated to the old Barracks and manged to take a long rest.

The next room was an assay office and contained the following treasure.

600 cp, 180 sp, 90 ep, and 60 gp.

Another chamber of bones was found and this time the party investigated the ceiling carefully for danger, unfortunately that gave time for 9 Skeleton to attack.   The party used the door way as a choke point and attacked with magic which quickly overwhelmed the attack.
