The never ending penultimate session continued, battered  from a hard battle with zombies and a flaming green skull the party did some disappointing looting, then the ooze decided to wear the skull as a trophy.     The party retreated to the safe area for a long rest.  Unfortunately this also allowed the still alive green skull to have a rest.  When the party returned to the furnace room the green skull took to the air unfortunately for the ooze it was still inside them.

The ooze removed the skull and fell to the floor taking damage.    A fight ensured with the ooze taking the brunt of the damage but with a concentrated attack the skull dropped to the floor (again).   This time the party decided to make sure the skull was killed for good.     Some of the party decided to follow the water course to try to get the water wheel turning.    This was achieved with only minimal damage to themselves.  With the blast furnace operating at full temperature the skull was dispatched.

Some of the party decided to jump into the fast flowing water as a short cut, this went as well as expected with the two characters swept past the rest of the party splitting the party into 3.   The bedraggled pair ended up in a cavern with 3 bug bears and a drow.    A fight ensured with the main part of the party arriving just after the drow somehow morphed into a tortle identical to oooo.    This caused some confusion for a bit but caster cleverly cast a spell to kill and reveal the impostor.  A hunt around in the cavern found some gauntlets of orge power.

Finding a locked door the party tired to slip past it unnoticed by failing to bash it down, then having an argument about who was good at picking locks.  this allowed the 5 bug bears to ambush the players when they finally got though the door.   An owl  familiar turned out to be of no use whatsoever but luckily a big flaming fireball from the druid took care of most of the bugbears but one manged to flee.  Wounded again the party secured the room and settled down for a long rest.
