The players found [[Thundertree]] and were met by a sign stating.

"DANGER! Plant Monsters AND Zombies! Turn around now!"

Being brave the players ignored the sign and continued into town were they met a wizard named [[Reidoth]], again he warned them of the danger and pleaded for them to turn around.    

When the players decided not to he went back to making squirrel stew.

Luckily the Plant Monsters mostly killed themselves around the players including catching each other alight!

The ash zombies proved slightly more competent but were soon defeated.

Like last session insects were the biggest danger to the party.  At least this time they had the excuse that the spiders were giant!    A few players got stuck in spider webs, but the players soon dispatched the remaining spiders.

The body of an elf was found in the spiders lair with the following on its body.

"studded leather armor,  a shortsword, potion of healing in a belt pouch, along with 23
gp and 35 sp."

There is still around half of [[Thundertree]] to explore.
