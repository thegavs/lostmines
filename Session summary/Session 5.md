The attack on the Redbrand hide out continues.

For once our heroes did not fight first but tried other tactics!

Disguises were donned and were effective but only for a while!   

Locks were picked even though the key to the door was found!

A trap was found, admittedly this was after a character had fallen in!

Prisoners were freed and hints of more treasure in other places.

A game of kick the goblin went very badly due to a players inability to kick arse.

A gambling game was won, admittedly by killing all the other players.

Angry bugbears were locked in a room and have now escaped and are quite angry!
