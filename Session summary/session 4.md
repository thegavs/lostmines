The party frisked the unconscious body of their employers friend [[Sildar Haliwinter]] only to find the goblins had already stolen anything of value.

Then the mysterious drop kobol came around and had a go at everyone for ruining is plan to get coin! but agreed to join the party.

[[Sildar Haliwinter]] told them that the [[Black spider]] had ordered the goblins to deliver [[Gundren Rockseeker]] and his maps to [[Cragmore castle]].  

[[Sildar Haliwinter]] paid the party 10gp each to escort him to [[Phandalin]] where they took up rooms in the [[Stonehill Inn]].

Once in town the party learned of various troubles in and around town.

A fight happened with the [[Redbrands]] killing 4 and capturing one.  This lead to information about their secret base under [[Tresendar Manor]].

The party found a secret tunnel that lead to the middle of the base where a fight ensured with a Nothic which unusually did not manage to kill any of the party.  It was defeated and treasure found.
