With a chest full of freshly severed orc heads the party headed to Agatha the Banshee to ask who built the tower at [[Old owl well]].    Agatha appeared and after some back and forth agreed to answer a single question from the most charismatic charactor at the time.

Unfortunately this was Bob,  now Bob was very polite and asked how she was doing.  Agatha answered "I am well now leave."  Agatha then disappeared.

Predictably an attempt was made to loot the lair but everything was ethereal and not real.

The party then left and used disguise self to come back as other people and eventually got the answer that Arthindol built the tower.

Returning to [[Old owl well]] aa discussion with [[Hamun Kost]] was had who paid the reward of 350GP for the 7 orc heads.    One member snuck into the tent and found a book that hinted about a lost army of undead hidden by Arthindol.

[[Hamun Kost]] was lured into the tower on the pretence of being interested in archaeology then swiftly dispatched by the party.

Unfortunately he had already summoned his small army of zombies.  Luckily the zombies were to dumb to use all the doors to the tower so came in single file which allowed them to be swiftly killed with only a few players falling over or shooting themselves in the head.

The tower was investigated and a coffin was found.    The large coffin was opened and an orge zombie wearing armour  this proved slightly harder to defeat even if it was pushed into a pit which mysteriously got deeper for comedic effect.

The body of [[Hamun Kost]] was looted and a small jeweled  box was found worth 25GP and a ring of protection.
