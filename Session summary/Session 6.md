A trap was laid for angry Bugbears and the kick arse Goblin, sadly this trap was not quite as effective as everyone hoped.

An attempt at at negotiation ended in the expected fight when someone insulted someones Mum.

3 Bugbears were killed, one escaped and the goblin captured.

Luckily the goblin knew the location of [[Cragmore castle]], unluckily the goblin was left unguarded and ran away before revealing this information.

[[Glasstaff]]'s workshop was found and looted,  scrolls and books were found.  One key book revealed the following.

"More than five hundred years ago, clans of dwarves and
gnomes made an agreement known as the Phandelver's
Pact, by which they would share a rich mine in a wondrous
cavern known as Wave Echo Cave. In addition to its
mineral wealth, the mine contained great magical power.
Human spellcasters allied themselves with the dwarves
and gnomes to channel and bind that energy into a great
forge (called the Forge of Spells), where magic items could
be crafted. Times were good, and the nearby human town
of Phandalin (pronounced fan-duh-lin) prospered as well.
But then disaster struck when ores swept through the
North and laid waste to all in their path.
A powerful force of ores reinforced by evil mercenary
wizards attacked Wave Echo Cave to seize its riches and
magic treasures. Human wizards fought alongside their
dwarf and gnome allies to defend the Forge of Spells, and
the ensuing spell battle destroyed much of the cavern.
Few survived the cave-ins and tremors, and the location of
Wave Echo Cave was lost."

A suspicious rat was captured and interrogated, after detect magic was used it was [[Glasstaff]]'s familiar which he was using to spy on the party.  This allowed him enough time to escape.

A note was found in [[Glasstaff]]'s bed chamber that read.

"Lord Albrek,
My spies in Neverwinter

on you, larno. Don't disappoint
me.
[[Black spider]]"

The party then returned to [[Phandalin]] and sold loot for 92GP each and were rewarded 120GP each for giving the books and scrolls to [[Halia Thornton]].   The note was passed to [[Sildar Haliwinter]] who was shocked that this old friend had turned to the dark side and was in fact [[Glasstaff]].

After a long rest the party decided to head to [[Thundertree]] to look for more clues and loot.

A lunch rest under a tree went badly when 8  Stirges attacked, these blood sucking parasites attacked the party, which lead to a few attempts to kill the Stirges by killing the hosts they were feeding on.  This lead to death saves!

A few miles later as dawn broke after a long rest 3 wolves attached, these proved to be less bother than the Stirges and were soon dispatched.

The party then had another long rest so start the next session rested.
