The party continued to explore [[Cragmore castle]], one member strolled confidently into an empty room, unfortunately it was empty of friends but full of hobgoblins.   Bravely the ooze ran away!  The attempt to barricade the door to contain the hobgoblins ended predictably in a fight then chase of the remaining hobgoblin.  The party then barricaded themselves into the room for a long rest and found a +1 attack quarter staff as loot.

Sleep was rudely interrupted by a returning patrol of hobgoblins and wolves.   These were swiftly dispatched and the party continued exploring, finding a tower with a door barricaded from the outside.  The party opened the door freeing a very hungry owl bear that immediately decided that the party were indeed food so attached.  The rouge in the party "helped" by spring out of hiding shooting an arrow in the vague direction of danger, missing then hiding again.  The wounded party managed to dispatch the poor staving beast then continued exploring.

In the last tower the party found the leader of the [[Cragmore castle]] goblins with his pet wolf.  Unconscious on the floor was [[Gundren Rockseeker]] the party's employer.  The intrepid Tortle steamed into action but did not check behind the door so was hit hard and onto death saving throws.  Luckily the [[Cragmore castle]] hobgoblin and the doppleganger sent by the [[Black spider]] started fighting amongst themselves which enabled the party to rescue and resuscitate [[Gundren Rockseeker]] and kill the remaining enemies.
