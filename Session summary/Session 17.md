Refreshed from a long rest our adventurers discovered a dark pool.  One plucky character jumped in to find that the water was only dark at the surface underneath was crystal clear,  On the bottom of the pool lay 3 skeletons, one with shiny things on it.     Another member of the party joined in the looting to find that two of the skeletons were undead and a brief  fight ensured.   Once really really dead the skeletons were looted gaining the following.

+1 short sword.
wand of magic missiles
gold chain 10 GP
two platinum rings worth 75GP each

The water from the pool exited via a tunnel which some of the party used like a water slide picking up some gold pieces on the way.  This lead to cavern the party had previously explored.  Two unexplored passageways lead from this cavern.  The party split up and listened at one door which seem to have happy voices inside.  A bat familer was sent in to look around and found a dwarf standing over the body of a hobgoblin.    The party entered and the dwarf introduced them selves as the brother of [[Gundren Rockseeker]].  

The other half of the party found a naked dwarf locked in a room who also claimed to be the brother of [[Gundren Rockseeker]].   With at least one imposter the party cast moonbeam which did expose the happy dwarf to be a doppleganger.  At this point the doppleganger, pretending to be dead hobgoblin and two gaint spiders attacked.

After the fight the party started to investigate the alter in the middle of the room.   Out of the alter arose a drow the [[Black spider]], firing off magic missiles at the party.  Another fight ensureed and the [[Black spider]] slumped to the ground defeated.

The party decided to check it was really dead at which point it turned into a Drider and clung to the ceiling attacking the party.  Luckily one attack was a NAT 1 so it fell to the floor to be attacked and defeated.

[[Phandalin]] and the surrounding area are saved!
